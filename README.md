# Text-Based-Adventure-game-project
Text based game project done in C++. Unfinished because I lost interest in the project. Originally I planned on making this game to practice C++ and apply what I was studying in my first semester of Coding classes 

based on Heldermann's text based adventure tutorial https://helderman.github.io/htpataic/htpataic01.html
